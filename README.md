## Website for a beautiful holiday home Northeast of England.

## Sep 12, 2017 update:
```
We're about 1/3 finished with the styling of the main page of the website. 
Noticeable issues have been with the SVG and its stubbornness to resize.
If the problem persists, I'll fall back on using fonts instead despite the resolution hit.
Over the past few days of coding I've come to link the idea of a single page website more and more.
If we apply lazy-load to the images the page load time will be inconsequential.
It would be then justifiable to have everything on a single page. With a few exceptions.
Will have to see if the client likes the idea of course as well as measure page
load time during stress testing later.
