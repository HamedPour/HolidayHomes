## Information Website - Holiday Home Northeast of England.

## Sep 12, 2017 - Dev Notes:
```
We're about 1/3 finished with the styling of the main page of the site.
Noticeable issues have been with the SVG and its stubbornness to resize.
If the problem persists, I'll fall back on using fonts instead despite the minor resolution hit.

```
I decided to halt progress on styling the rest of the page until I had implemented some necessary JavaScript before the file became too crowded. Added js for the dynamic sticky Nav as well as readjusted the carousel setting to get a crisper picture resolution in smaller viewports. The Nav gave us a hard time with it’s “position: fixed” since it seemed to have a bug with chrome. It has been resolved.
