## Information Website - Holiday Home Northeast of England.

## Sep 12, 2017 - Dev Notes:
```
We're about 1/3 finished with the styling of the main page of the site.
Noticeable issues have been with the SVG and its stubbornness to resize.
If the problem persists, I'll fall back on using fonts instead despite the minor resolution hit.
```

## Sep 15, 2017 - Dev Notes:
```
I decided to halt progress on styling the rest of the page until I had implemented some necessary
JavaScript before the file became too crowded. Added js for the dynamic sticky Nav as well as
readjusted the carousel Septing to get a crisper picture resolution in smaller viewports.
The Nav gave us a hard time with it’s “position: fixed” since it seemed to have a bug with
chrome. It has been resolved.  
```

```
The bulk of the main page styling is finished. Notable changes were made to font
sizes and margins - After having a chat with the client we decided to increase
the size by 20% for better readability. From here I’ll be focusing on the second
html page for room details. After which comes mobile optimization. Notable issues
to overcome are currently section heights, navbar hrefs, and failure to use App.js
for the second html without it flagging errors.

```
The Parallax gave us a very hard time. It was an issue with the docs folder not
rendering the images for some reason. It was mostly an issue with relative referencing.
In the end after consulting with the client we decided not to include the parallax.
It was nonetheless a valuable learning experience.  
```

## Sep 28, 2017 - Dev Notes:
```
We've completed the second and last html for our holiday home. Distancing from
the Parallax module and using a more traditional, comfy style instead.
Due to RL issues it took longer than expected and the grid system gave us a lot
of trouble when it came to resizing for mobile rotation. Once the client is
satisfied with the design, we'll begin optimization.

```
Completed gallery using lightbox as well as optimized the other static pages.
Our Google pageSpeed Insights is very good on all three esp with the addition
of lazyload.
What remains next is further polish and content addition.
```
## Oct 04, 2017 - Dev Notes:
```
Today marks the completion of the website layout and styling. All that remains is
to optimize for mobile, slow connections and latency browsers. As well as sort
out meta tags and hashing.
