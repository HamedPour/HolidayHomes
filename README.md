## Information Website - Holiday Home Northeast of England.

## Sep 12, 2017 - Dev Notes:
```
We're about 1/3 finished with the styling of the main page of the site.
Noticeable issues have been with the SVG and its stubbornness to resize.
If the problem persists, I'll fall back on using fonts instead despite the minor resolution hit.

```
I decided to halt progress on styling the rest of the page until I had implemented some necessary
JavaScript before the file became too crowded. Added js for the dynamic sticky Nav as well as
readjusted the carousel setting to get a crisper picture resolution in smaller viewports.
The Nav gave us a hard time with it’s “position: fixed” since it seemed to have a bug with
chrome. It has been resolved.

```
The bulk of the main page styling is finished. Notable changes were made to font
sizes and margins - After having a chat with the client we decided to increase
the size by 20% for better readability. From here I’ll be focusing on the second
html page for room details. After which comes mobile optimization. Notable issues
to overcome are currently section heights, navbar hrefs, and failure to use App.js
for the second html without it flagging errors.
