# PostCSS-Starter-Kit

My collection of PostCSS addons for a quick and fast setup of a development environment.

## Getting Started

Type "gulp" in command line to initiate browser-sync.
Type "gulp icons" to generate SVG sprite from the files in your "icon" directory.
Type "gulp build" to produce the dist folder.
Type "gulp previewDist" to preview the compiled dist folder and finished website.   

### Prerequisites

Run "npm install".
Run "gulp" (which will run gulp watch by default).
```
npm install
gulp
```
